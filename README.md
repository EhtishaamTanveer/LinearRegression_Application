# Linear Regression Project

This Github Repo contains a Linear Regression project 

** Linear Regression ** is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used to predict the value of a variable in relation with another variable. This is mostly used when you have quantitative data.

The ultimate aim of this project is to built a Linear Regression model from scratch and come up with an optimal line of best fit.

I started working on this project all by myself while completing my Coursera specialization called "[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NG3GPTVN7M8E?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=s12n)"
